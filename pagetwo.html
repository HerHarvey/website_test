    <h2>How do I organize a paragraph?</h2>
    <p>There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you choose will depend on the controlling idea of the paragraph. <strong>Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief examples:</strong></p>

        <p><b>Narration:</b> Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/"> See an example.</a>)
        <br><b>Description:</b> Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or feels like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/"> See an example.<a>)
        <br><b>Process:</b> Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first, second, third. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/"> See an example.</a>)
        <br><b>Classification:</b> Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (<a href="https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/paragraphs/paragraph-development-examples/"> See an example.</a>)
        <br><b>Illustration:</b> Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an example in the 5-step process below.)</p>

    <h2>Illustration paragraph: a 5-step example
    </h2>
    <p>From the list above, let’s choose <em>“illustration”</em> as our rhetorical purpose. We’ll walk through a 5-step process for building a paragraph that illustrates a point in an argument. For each step there is an explanation and example. Our example paragraph will be about human misconceptions of piranhas.</p>

    <h3>Step 1. Decide on a controlling idea and create a topic sentence</h3>
    <p>Paragraph development begins with the formulation of the controlling idea. This idea directs the paragraph’s development. Often, the controlling idea of a paragraph will appear in the form of a topic sentence. In some cases, you may need more than one sentence to express a paragraph’s controlling idea.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>Controlling idea and topic sentence</b> — Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans.</p>

    <h3>Step 2. Elaborate on the controlling idea</h3>
    <p>Paragraph development continues with an elaboration on the controlling idea, perhaps with an explanation, implication, or statement about significance. Our example offers a possible explanation for the pervasiveness of the myth.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>Elaboration</b> — DThis impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media.</p>

    <h3>Step 3. Give an example (or multiple examples)</h3>
    <p>Paragraph development progresses with an example (or more) that illustrates the claims made in the previous sentences.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>Example</b> — For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film <em>Piranha</em> features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman.</p>

    <h3>Step 4. Explain the example(s)</h3>
    <p>The next movement in paragraph development is an explanation of each example and its relevance to the topic sentence. The explanation should demonstrate the value of the example as evidence to support the major claim, or focus, in your paragraph.</p><p>Continue the pattern of giving examples and explaining them until all points/examples that the writer deems necessary have been made and explained. NONE of your examples should be left unexplained. You might be able to explain the relationship between the example and the topic sentence in the same sentence which introduced the example. More often, however, you will need to explain that relationship in a separate sentence.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>Explanation for example</b> — Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear.</p><p>Notice that the example and explanation steps of this 5-step process (steps 3 and 4) can be repeated as needed. The idea is that you continue to use this pattern until you have completely developed the main idea of the paragraph.</p>

    <h3>Step 5. Complete the paragraph’s idea or transition into the next paragraph</h3>
    <p>The final movement in paragraph development involves tying up the loose ends of the paragraph. At this point, you can remind your reader about the relevance of the information to the larger paper, or you can make a concluding point for this example. You might, however, simply transition to the next paragraph.</p>
    <p>&emsp;<b>Sentences for completing a paragraph </b> — While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</p>

    <h3>Finished paragraph</h3>
    <p>Despite the fact that piranhas are relatively harmless, many people continue to believe the pervasive myth that piranhas are dangerous to humans. This impression of piranhas is exacerbated by their mischaracterization in popular media. For example, the promotional poster for the 1978 horror film <em>Piranha</em> features an oversized piranha poised to bite the leg of an unsuspecting woman. Such a terrifying representation easily captures the imagination and promotes unnecessary fear. While the trope of the man-eating piranhas lends excitement to the adventure stories, it bears little resemblance to the real-life piranha. By paying more attention to fact than fiction, humans may finally be able to let go of this inaccurate belief.</p>
